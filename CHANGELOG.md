# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **BREAKING (CLI):** `basicly install` replaces `init` and `update` — one
  idempotent converge command performs first install *and* every upgrade
  (materialize the bundled catalog, scaffold overlay + `basicly.toml` without
  overwriting user content, then `build` + `skills-build` + `hooks-build` with
  hook activation). The legacy-layout migration and legacy-source pruning that
  `update` performed now run inside `install`.
- **BREAKING (catalog source format):** catalog content is now authored as YAML
  sources — skills as `core/skills/<slug>/skill.yaml` and fragments as
  `core/fragments/**/<id>.fragment.yaml` — instead of the discoverable `SKILL.md`
  and `*.fragment.md` names. The projectors render the agent-loaded `.md` files
  (`SKILL.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `copilot-instructions.md`, rules and
  instructions) at the target roots only, so a broadly-scanning agent can no
  longer double-load a skill. Rendered output is unchanged except for a
  "generated" marker on projected `SKILL.md` files.

### Added

- JSON Schemas for skill and fragment sources (`core/schemas/`), referenced from
  each source via a `# yaml-language-server` header for editor/agent validation.
- `catalog-authoring` skill and an always-on authoring fragment covering how to
  write and project catalog sources.
- `basicly skills-new` and `basicly fragment-new` scaffold commands.
- `basicly catalog-lint` gate (schema validation, no `.md`-named sources, single
  `.yaml` extension), wired as a pre-commit hook and a CI step.

### Migration

- `basicly install` prunes legacy discoverable-name sources (`SKILL.md`,
  `*.fragment.md`) from the managed core, so installing basicly over a
  pre-migration hand-copied catalog cleans up the old sources automatically. The
  user overlay (`.basicly-local/`) is never touched.
