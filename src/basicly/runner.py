"""Agent-agnostic runner adapters (onb.7).

A *runner* is the thin adapter that invokes a coding agent headless to do a
node's work in its worktree (architecture §12.8): an invocation command, its
headless flags, how the prompt is injected, and how output is captured. The loop
logic is agent-neutral; only the runner differs per agent, so the same loop runs
identically under Claude, Codex, or Copilot.

Two kinds:

- ``headless`` — a known CLI (claude/codex/copilot, or any agent added via
  config) invoked non-interactively with the prompt injected as an argument or
  on stdin, output captured.
- ``handoff`` — the safe fallback. There is no cross-agent CLI invocation
  standard, so this runner **never guesses** an unknown agent's command line.
  When no known CLI is on PATH and none is configured, it degrades to the loop's
  block-and-resume contract: it surfaces the exact prompt + worktree path and
  leaves the work to whoever is driving (the current agent or a human), who then
  re-invokes. That leans on the two things that *are* standardized — the
  projected AGENTS.md guidance and the tracker-backed resumability.

Command templates are config-driven with the built-in defaults below; verify any
one before a live run with ``basicly runner dry-run``.
